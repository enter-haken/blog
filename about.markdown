Hi, my name is Jan Frederik Hake. I am a software developer from Dortmund / Germany. 

I've been coding for years on different topics.
I prefer do work as a full stack engineer, because every part of an application has its challenge and its charm. 

I have been working on / with

* clustered relational databases with hundreds of tables and thousands of stored procedures
* code bases with more than a quarter million lines of code
* [brownfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)) projects / products
* document based database systems with millions of documents and terabytes in size
* [extjs](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) based web applications

This is my personal blog, where I write about programming, infrastructure and own ideas. 
I start with some simple pages and let this blog grow as needed.
